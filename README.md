This project on terraform shows a deployed VPC in us-east-1 containing a NGINX server. An IGW, Route table, and public subnets were configured to allow ingress traffic to flow through ports 443 and 80. The NGINX server is known for its high performance, efficiency and stability that can be used as reverse proxy. NGNIX server also contains a load balancer and HTTP cache. Load balancers perform health checks on your servers while distributing traffic evenly across containers, servers and IP adresses. After deployment the IPv4 address was then copied in the search engine to visualize the NGINX GUI (Graphical User Interphase).
